# moodle-local_enrolstaff
Allows staff to self-enrol onto Moodle courses.

User searches for a course then selects a role from the list.

An email is sent to any unit leaders for the course letting them know someone has enrolled onto their course.

Users can also bulk un-enrol from courses.

Code is currently hard coded to suit SSU.
